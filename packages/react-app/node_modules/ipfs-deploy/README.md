The goal of `ipfs-deploy` is to make it as easy as possible to
**deploy a static website to IPFS.**

## Install

```bash
npm install -g ipfs-deploy
```

Or

```bash
yarn global add ipfs-deploy
```

You can call it either as `ipd` or as `ipfs-deploy`:

```bash
ipd public/
ipfs-deploy public/
```

### No install

You can run it directly with [npx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx 'npx')
without needing to install anything:

```bash
npx ipfs-deploy _site
```

It will deploy to a public pinning service and give you a link to
`ipfs.io/ipfs/your-hash` so you can check it out.

## Usage

You can get started just by typing out `ipd` and it will have smart defaults.
By default, it deploys to Infura, which doesn't need signup and you'll get a
link like `ipfs.io/ipfs/QmHash` that you can use to see if everything went ok.

When you don't specify a path argument to deploy, `ipfs-deploy` tries to
guess it for you based on the build directories used by the most popular static
site generators by the following order:

| Path            | Static generators                       |
| --------        | ---------------------------------       |
| `_site`         | jekyll, hakyll, eleventy                |
| `site`          | some others                             |
| `public`        | gatsby, hugo                            |
| `dist`          | nuxt                                    |
| `output`        | pelican                                 |
| `out`           | hexo                                    |
| `build`         | create-react-app, metalsmith, middleman |
| `website/build` | docusaurus                              |
| `docs`          | many others                             |

Some pinning services and DNS providers require signup and additional
environment variables to be set. We support and use `.env` files. Read
the section bellow to find out about which services are supported and
how to ensable them.

For further information about the CLI, please run `ipfs-deploy --help`.

### Supported Pinning Services

Some things to keep in mind:

-  Please note the `__` (double underscore) between some words (such as
after `PINATA` and `CLOUDFLARE`).
-  **Don't** commit the `.env` file to source control unless you know what
you're doing.

These services are subject to their terms. Not a decentralization nirvana
by any stretch of the imagination, but a nice way to get started quickly with a
blog, static website, or frontend web app.

#### [Infura](https://infura.io)

Infura is a freemium pinning service that doesn't require any additional setup.
It's the default one used. Please bear in mind that Infura is a free service,
so there is probably a rate-limiting.

##### How to enable

Use flag `-p infura`.

#### [Pinata](https://pinata.cloud)

Pinata is another freemium pinning service. It gives you more control over
what's uploaded. You can delete, label and add costum metadata. This service
requires signup.

##### Environment variables

```bash
IPFS_DEPLOY_PINATA__API_KEY=<api key>
IPFS_DEPLOY_PINATA__SECRET_API_KEY=<secret api key>
```

##### How to enable

Use flag `-p pinata`.

#### [Fission](https://fission.codes)

Fission is a backend-as-a-service that uses IPFS and supports pinning. This service requires signup.

##### Environment variables

```bash
IPFS_DEPLOY_FISSION__USERNAME=<username>
IPFS_DEPLOY_FISSION__PASSWORD=<password>
```

##### How to enable

Use flag `-p fission`.

#### [IPFS Cluster](https://cluster.ipfs.io/)

You can use IPFS Cluster to pin your website. It can be either self-hosted or
just any IPFS Cluster you want.

##### Environment variables

```bash
IPFS_DEPLOY_IPFS_CLUSTER__HOST=<multiaddr>
IPFS_DEPLOY_IPFS_CLUSTER__USERNAME=<basic auth username>
IPFS_DEPLOY_IPFS_CLUSTER__PASSWORD=<basic auth password>
```

##### How to enable

Use flag `-p ipfs-cluster`.

### Supported DNS Providers

#### [Cloudflare DNS](https://cloudflare.com)

Cloudflare is a freemium DNS provider. Supports CNAME flattening for
naked domains and integrates with their IPFS gateway at
[cloudflare-ipfs.com](https://cloudflare-ipfs.com).

Bear in mind that Cloudflare IPFS doesn't host the content itself
(it's a cached gateway), so a stable pinning service is needed if you
don't want to rely on your computer's IPFS daemon's availability to
serve your website.

##### Environment variables

```bash
# credentials
IPFS_DEPLOY_CLOUDFLARE__API_EMAIL=
IPFS_DEPLOY_CLOUDFLARE__API_KEY=

# dns info
IPFS_DEPLOY_CLOUDFLARE__ZONE=
IPFS_DEPLOY_CLOUDFLARE__RECORD=
```

Example with top-level domain:

```bash
# cloudflare dns info
IPFS_DEPLOY_CLOUDFLARE__ZONE=agentofuser.com
IPFS_DEPLOY_CLOUDFLARE__RECORD=_dnslink.agentofuser.com
```

Example with subdomain:

```bash
# cloudflare dns info
IPFS_DEPLOY_CLOUDFLARE__ZONE=agentofuser.com
IPFS_DEPLOY_CLOUDFLARE__RECORD=_dnslink.mysubdomain.agentofuser.com
```

##### How to enable

Use flag `-d cloudflare`.

## API

This is still pretty unstable and subject to change, so I will just show how
the executable currently uses the API.

```javascript
const deploy = require('ipfs-deploy')

;(async () => {
  try {
    const deployOptions = {
      publicDirPath: argv.path,
      copyHttpGatewayUrlToClipboard:
        !(argv.clipboard === false) && !argv.C && !argv.noClipboard,
      open: !(argv.open === false) && !argv.O && !argv.noOpen,
      remotePinners: argv.pinner,
      dnsProviders: argv.dns,
      siteDomain: argv.siteDomain,
      credentials: {
        cloudflare: {
          apiKey: argv.cloudflare && argv.cloudflare.apiKey,
          apiEmail: argv.cloudflare && argv.cloudflare.apiEmail,
          zone: argv.cloudflare && argv.cloudflare.zone,
          record: argv.cloudflare && argv.cloudflare.record,
        },
        pinata: {
          apiKey: argv.pinata && argv.pinata.apiKey,
          secretApiKey: argv.pinata && argv.pinata.secretApiKey,
        },
        fission: {
          username: argv.fission && argv.fission.username,
          password: argv.fission && argv.fission.password,
        },
        ipfsCluster: {
          host: argv.ipfsCluster && argv.ipfsCluster.host,
          username: argv.ipfsCluster && argv.ipfsCluster.username,
          password: argv.ipfsCluster && argv.ipfsCluster.password,
        },
      },
    }

    deploy(deployOptions)
  } catch (e) {}
})()
```

## Security

We use `dotenv` to handle credentials. Don't commit your `.env` file to source
control.

### Add a Pinning Service

To add support to a new pinning service, you must start by creating a file with
the name of the pinning service. Let's say it's called PinFree: create a file
called `src/pinners/pinfree.js` with a content similar to this one:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  name: 'PinFree',
  builder: opts => {
    // Validate the options. If bad, throw.
    // Return an api or the options you want to use later.

    return api
  },
  pinDir: async (api, dir, tag) => {
    // Pin a directory asynchronously, using the api
    // returned by builder and a tag.

    return hash
  },
  pinHash: async (api, hash, tag) => {
    // Pin an hash asynchronously, using the api
    // returned by builder and a tag.
    // Just throw an error if the service doesn't
    // support this action.
  },
}
```

Now, you have your pinner service almost set up. Go to `src/pinners/index.js`
and add your pinner like this to the exports:

```javascript
pinfree: makePinner(require('./pinfree')),
```

Finally, go to `bin/ipfs-deploy.js` and add `pinfree` to the list of supported
pinners. Also, do not forget to update the README with the new options.

### Add a DNS Provider

To add support to a new DNS service, you must start by creating a file with the
name of the DNS service. Let's say it's called DNSFree: create a file called
`dnsfree.js` with a content similar to this one:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  name: 'DNSFree',
  validate: opts => {
    // Validate the options. If bad, throw.
  },
  link: async (domain, hash, opts) => {
    // DNSLink the domain to the hash using the
    // validated options.

    return {
      record: someValue,
      value: someOtherValue,
    }
  },
}
```

Now, you have your DNS service almost set up. Go to `src/dnslink/index.js` and
add your pinner like this to the exports:

```javascript
dnsfree: makeDnslink(require('./dnsfree')),
```

Finally, go to `bin/ipfs-deploy.js` and add `dnsfree` to the list of supported
DNS providers. Also, do not forget to update the README with the new options.
